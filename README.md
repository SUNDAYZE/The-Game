Hello all,
I will be creating a mini block game.
This block game will comprise of two characters a red block and a blue block.
The purpose of the game is to allow the red block to jump and avid the blue block.
The red block will jump everytime the user clicks on the mouse.
Every time user loses the game a pop up window will display a game over and score.
